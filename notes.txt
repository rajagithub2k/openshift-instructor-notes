BUILDS & DEPLOYMENTS
====================
oc start-build|cancel-build <BC_NAME>
oc rollout latest|history|cancel|retry|pause|resume|status|undo <DC_NAME>
oc rollback <DC_NAME>

oc set triggers bc|dc <RT_NAME> [--from-config] [--from-image=<URI>] [--from-github] [--from-webhook] [--auto] [--remove]

oc set build-hook bc/<RT_NAME> --post-commit --command <CMD> [--verbose]
oc set build-hook bc/<RT_NAME> --post-commit --script <SCRIPT>

oc set env dc <RT_NAME> --from {cm/<RT_NAME> | secret/<RT_NAME>}

oc set volume dc <RT_NAME> --add -t secret/cm {--secret-name <SECRET_NAME> | --configmap-name <CM_NAME>} -m <MNT_PATH> --name <NEW_VOL_NAME>

IMAGE MANAGEMENT
================
skopeo copy|delete|inspect --creds <USER>:<PASS> [--src-tls-verify] [--dest-tls-verify] <LOCATION>...
where,
        <LOCATION> = location of image
                   = docker://<REGISTRY>/<USER|GROUP>/<IMAGE>[:TAG]
                   = oci:<PATH>

Service Name used in PODs
=========================
2 Ways of using Service:
	1. ENVIRONMENT VAR
	  <SERVICE_NAME>_SERVICE_HOST environment variable in pods. Service has to be created first.

	2. DNS
	  <SERVICE_NAME>.<PROJECT_NAME>.svc.cluster.local FQDN name.


Route Name created by OpenShift
===============================
	<ROUTE_NAME>-<PROJ_NAME>.<DOMAIN_WILDCARD>
	<DOMAIN_WILDCARD> = apps.<BASE_DOMAIN>


Troubleshoot Certificate Signing
================================
export KUBECONFIG={kubeconfig CERT file}
oc get csr
oc adm certificate approve {list of id's from oc get csr with pending status}


Chap 8
======
Operators
---------
	oc get clusterversion
	oc describe clusterversion			# check cluster status
	oc get co					# list cluster operators
	oc get crd | grep <keyword>			# find CRD related to co
	oc get <CRD>					# to list the CR
	oc get <CRD> <CR> -o yaml | grep -i apiversion -A1	# to get <apiversion> and <kind>
	oc explain <kind>.spec --api-version <apiversion>	# learn contents of CR


	Tips:
		* you can also use 'oc describe co <CO-NAME>' to check what are the CRs used by the cluster operators, under "Related Objects".


Chap 9
======
Checking Cluster Health
-----------------------
	oc adm node-logs [-u {crio|kubelet}] <MASTER_NODE>
	oc debug node/<MASTER_NODE>				# access master node
		oc debug node/master01
		chroot /host
	crictl ps 						# check containers

	Tips:
		Other than the base services(kubelet and cri-o) and static/regular pods checking, it's also useful to check the status of the operators as listed in Chap 8 above. After all, the whole cluster IS MANAGED by the operators.
